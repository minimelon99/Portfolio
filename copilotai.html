              CoPilot AI is a lead generation platform for LinkedIn Social
              Prospecting purposes. This is done in my design internship. I
              worked with the Lead Product Designer, Sales Team, Customer
              Success and Developers.

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
              CoPilot is moving to a new platform with an entirely new user
              interface. Since our users are mostly non-tech literate users, we
              must ensure the our the onboarding process, user experience and
              key userflow (Inbox) is easy to use.
            </p>
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>
              Redesigning the new platform that is easier for the users but also
              more efficient for employees during onboarding. Improving the
              issue in the old platform.
            </p>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
              Copilot is a service that automates the process of social
              prospecting through Linkedin. It uses AI to separate message
              obtained into different categories, which allows users to respond
              to messages and manage leads.

              I started by understanding who our key users are.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our key users are financial advisors who have done things the old
              school way and are now exploring new options. Social prospecting
              is significantly different from the walk-in and referrals, which
              is why our users have a hard time adjusting.

            />
            <p>
              As we are changing to a new platform, it’s crucial to understand
              the differences, where we are improving and what problems we are
              solving from the old platform. What are the painpoints and what's
              new about the new platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              I looked at the different user roles and the parts of the
              onboarding process that could be improved

            <p>
              After doing user testing, I realized the message tiles the user
              responded to messages on was missing key information like: their
              lead's company and their job title.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user heavily rely on that information to determine how they
              respond.

              After interviewing the sales and the customer success team, I was

            </p>
            <p>
              I discovered that there was a high amount of customers who end up
              churning after the onboarding process due to not knowing how to
              sell through social media. This was extremely useful information
              as I was redesigning the onboarding process.

          <div>
            <h3>Working with Developers</h3>
            <p>
              I learned how to be a team player with developers while designing.
              Before I was eyeballing my designs but later learned that when
              handing off designs, the padding and measurements should be
              accurate and consistent
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Working Collaboratively</h3>
            <p>
              When you need a quick user testing, the people who knows customer
              best is customer success and sales. Not only were they able to
              give amazing feedback, they are also able to give more insight on
              personas that I couldn’t achieve alone.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h3>Learning the Fast Pace of Startups and Direction</h3>
            <p>
              My experience with CoPilot was great because they are not afraid
              to experiment and fail fast. Which meant they are constantly
              changing their direction including users. I had to adapt quickly
              to catch up.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Learning the Complexity of Onboarding</h3>
            <p>
              Copilot’s key userflow is quite straightforward however the
              onboarding process is tedious and hefty. I really under valued the
              importance of onboarding prior to CoPilot.
