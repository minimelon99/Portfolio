            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
              Our customer success team spends a lot of time on the administration of customer billing - which is quite manual, tedious, and error-prone.
            </p>
            <p>- CS spends 30 min/day on billing
              <br/>
            - Director of Sales & CS spends 5 hours/week</p>
            <h2>My role</h2>
            <p>
              Look into what was "manual, tedious and error-prone" and provide a scalable solution for the team. Own the end-to-end design.
            </p>
            <h2>Outcomes</h2>
            <p>
             Created a scalable billing module which integrates into our platform, as well as other products. Reduced the time spend on billing per CS.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
              I conducted expert interviews with customer success team and directors to understand their pain points about billing and mapped out a user journey to visualize the issues</p>
            <img
              src="./img/billing/journeymap.png"
              alt="user journey"
              loading="lazy"
            />
              <p>To summarize the problems found:</p>
              <p>1. When updating billing, there was no connection between the software and the CRM, often creating errors when the CS rep forgets to update a software. This was a problem when changing and cancelling subscriptions. (esp when scheduling ahead of time)</p>
              <p>2. Coupons were being misused, creating billing errors</p>
              <p>3. Lack of automated subscription renewal reminders, causing the customer to think they "got overcharged".</p>
              <p>4. Customer does not have any form of visibility towards their billing</p>
              <p>5. Referral discounts are managed and applied manually</p>
              <p>6. Stripe was not 100% compatible with our data reporting platform, hence workarounds with coupon was used</p>

          </div>
          <div class="process-block">
            <h2>Vision & Prioritization</h2>
            <p>
              After understanding the problems, I worked with my PM to break the issues down into smaller categories, both defining the vision of what this billing module would entail, and the strategy to get there.
            </p>

              loading="lazy"
            />
            <p>We decided to proceed with building an internal billing module, focusing on:
              <br/>
              1. Billing Visibility: ability to see your customer's billing without going to Stripe
              <br/>
              2. Subscription Change: Ability to change your customer's subscription directly on the platform

            <h2>Wireframes for Billing Visibility</h2>
            <p>
              Brainstormed different locations where the billing could be located. While the user testing went well, I got feedback that the design was not scalable long term.
            </p>
            <img

          />
          <p>
            I still got feedback that the page can be more scalable if we looked at how receipts and components worked. I iterated my design based on that feedback. 
          </p>
          <p>I separated the Current Subscription, Next Invoice and Most Recent Invoice into different components</p>

            <p>
              Due to the complexity of billing, there was over 15 edge cases just to change a subscription. Worked really close with engineering and PM to tackle the edge cases.

            <p>Some examples includes:
              <br/>
              1. Subtotal, Total, Amount Due
              <br/>
              2. Coupon, Discount, Credit Balance

            <h3>Documentation is Therapeutic</h3>
            <p>
           Prior to this project, I did not document my work. Since this project required so much collaboration with engineering and stakeholders, a clear documentation was necessary to communicate all the edgecases and changes

            <h3>Stakeholder Management</h3>
            <p>
              I learned so much on stakeholder management, I wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/how-i-went-from-a-design-punching-bag-to-a-lead-designer-113d47db1970">medium article</a> about it.

            <p>
              Prior to this project, a lot of what I worked on was focused on short term benefits that was not scalable long term. After this project, I understood why having long term vision is important.
