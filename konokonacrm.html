            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Managing 600+ artist applications for your artist alley can get
              chaotic. Contacting artists, moving them off waitlists and
              obtaining payments are just some of their issues. A bad experience
              for organizers also means more anxiety for the artists.
            </p>
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>
              To create a better experience for organizers trying to manage
              hundreds of artist applications.
            </p>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
              Anime convention organizers are all volunteers with a full time
              job. They are extremely limited on time. Many conventions still
              use a manual way of applications.

              I started the project by interviewing several artists and

              Upon interviewing several anime convention organizers, I was able

            <p>
              Organizing a convention is a very heavy on logistical task. I
              listed out the logistic data and features that organizers will
              need to manage a convention
            </p>
            <p>
              Things like: randomizer for lottery applications, application
              status, setting a payment deadline for artists, & automating a
              waitlist process
            </p>
            <p>
              If tables were sold traditionally, first come first serve, the
              tables would sell out as fast as in 10 seconds or less. Organizers
              tend to do lottery applications as it's more fair to those with
              mobility disability and those who work in the service industry.

              Upon my first user testing session with an organizer, I realized
              that the design was not what the organizers want. As I was only
              thinking about the artist with portfolios and websites, I did not
              occur to me that logistic information was far more imporant to
              organizers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon digging futher, I learned that the information organizers
              actually care about are the things related to event organizing
              like:
              <br />
              1. Table size that the artist choose
              <br />
              2. Application status
              <br />
              3. Cost of order and total cost

            <h3>Understanding the importance of a Spreadsheet Layout</h3>
            <p>
              The hardest part about this project was learning how I could sort
              through 600+ applications without looking like a huge mess. What I
              learned was that spreadsheets are an amazing way to keep track of
              a massive amount of information.
