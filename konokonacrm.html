            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Managing 600+ artist applications for your artist alley can get
              chaotic. Contacting artists, moving them off waitlists and
              obtaining payments are just some of their issues. A bad experience
              for organizers also means more anxiety for the artists.
            </p>
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>
              To create a better experience for organizers trying to manage
              hundreds of artist applications.
            </p>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
              Anime convention organizers are all volunteers with a full time
              job. They are extremely limited on time. Many conventions still
              use a manual way of applications.

            <p>
              I started the project by interviewing several artists and
              organizers. I also at different application forms and applied to some conventions myself. I created an affinity map with the information that I
              obtained from them.
            </p>
            <p>Key learnings out of my primary research:
              <br/>
              1. Understanding the logistic complexity of event planning (venue, spacing, insurance, coordination, etc)
              <br/>
              2. Understanding who my personas are

            <p>
              I was define what anime organizer personas look like. Key learning is that a lot of these people have full time jobs outside of event planning and are doing this out of passion. This makes their time extremely valuable.

            <p>
              Organizing a convention is a very heavy on logistical task. I
              listed out the logistic data and features that organizers will
              need to manage a convention
            </p>
            <p>
              Things like: randomizer for lottery applications, application
              status, setting a payment deadline for artists, & automating a
              waitlist process
            </p>
            <p>
              If tables were sold traditionally, first come first serve, the
              tables would sell out as fast as in 10 seconds or less. Organizers
              tend to do lottery applications as it's more fair to those with
              mobility disability and those who work in the service industry.

            <p>
              Upon my first user testing session with an organizer, I realized
              that my entire design was assumption focused and was not solving the organizer's problems. I was only
              thinking about the artist's perspective with the need to see their portfolios and websites, I did not
              occur to me that logistic information was far more imporant to organizers.
              <br/>
              Turns out: Organizers don't really care about what you create, nor your skill level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon digging futher, I learned that the information organizers
              actually care about are the things related to event organizing
              like:
              <br />
              1. Table size that the artist choose
              <br />
              2. Managing the application status of the artists
              <br />
              3. Understanding the cost of order, total cost and setting deadlines
              <br/>
              4. They want to see & process a massive amount of information at a high level. Like a spreadsheet

              loading="lazy"
            />
            <p>
              I made the changes based on organizer feedback and proceeded to get more feedback from organizers but also tech professionals
            </p>
            <p>
              I was able to see the "AHA moment" in the reactions of the organizers. They told me this would make an incredible impact to their day to day workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Otherwise, there was still improvements to the user interface I was able to make to help users view information easier. I was recommended to look into Airtable

            <p>My key accomplishments through this project is:</p>
            <p>1. Getting the AHA moment out of multiple different artist alley organizers
              <br/>
              2. Impressed the former CEO of Picatic, and was invited to their office.
              <br>
              3. Could save WEEKS of organizer time managing applications

            <h3>Understanding the importance of a spreadsheet layout</h3>
            <p>
              The hardest part about this project was learning how I could sort
              through 600+ applications without looking like a huge mess. What I
              learned was that spreadsheets are an amazing way to keep track of
              a massive amount of information.

          <div>
            <h3>Designing for Web and Mobile</h3>
            <p>
              Working on this allowed me to better understand the challenges
              of responsive design.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Validate all assumptions</h3>
            <p>
              When I conducted my first user test on the organizers, it was clear I didn't create what they needed. In fact, my entire design direction was wrong. Through feedback, I was able to create something the organizers needed than what I thought they needed.
