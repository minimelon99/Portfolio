            <p>
              We have a 20-year-old feature-bloated product, severely slowing our feature velocity; blocking the company’s ability to innovate.
            </p>
            <p>Our clients also wanted pieces of our solutions to solve their own business needs. However, this cannot be achieved, as we can only give them all or nothing. 
            </p>
            <h2>Company strategy</h2>
            <p>
              The goal is to modularize pieces of our giant product and turn it into solutions that integrates seamlessly with each other.
            </p>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>
              As the lead designer on the in-store experience team, our short term goal is to release the modularized point-of-sale by early 2023 so our strategic partner can pilot in-stores.
            </p>
            <p>Our long term goal is to reduce the transaction time by 30%</p>

            <p>
              I started the project by interviewing several artists and
              organizers. I created an affinity map with the information that I
              obtained from them
            </p>
            <p>My key learnings were:
              <br/>
              1. Artist has no transparency towards when a convention will open their applications, as it's not the first thing advertised on the event website.
              <br/>
              2. Finding the page to the application also takes time. If your lucky they will have maillist. If not, you have to check weekly. Put this at scale with 5+ conventions.
              <br/>
              3. A lot of artist relies on discord or facebook community groups to get reminded when applications open.
              <br>
              4. This often happens 6 month before the event. Should artist miss it, it creates a painpoint with how much inventory they should order from the manufacturer.

            <p>Userflow was good, but I got some feedback that it would be nice to see:
              <br/>
              1. The artist alley layout
              <br/>
              2. More information about the area, transit and where to stay as a lot of artists travel to sell.

            <p>2. Good to have: more general information</p>

              To decrease the time for artists to repeated enter the same information during the application process, I split them into
              two categories, the static and the dynamic information
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Static</b> Information being the information that never
              changes. Things like name, address, portfolio, website. All
              organizers need this information, and the user should not have to
              repeatedly input this information
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Dynamic</b> Information being the information that changes. Who
              your table partner is and what your table name will be is always
              something that constantly gets changed
            </p>

            <p>
              Application is also on mobile view as a lot of artists has other
              jobs in the service industry, and cannot easily access a computer.
              However, when I did my initial interviews, many artists would not
              apply for an application through their phones due to the fear of
              making mistakes.

            <p>
              Half way through the project, I learned about designing for
              accessibility, and realized that none of my colors passed
              accessibility criterias. I changed the colors that didn't pass the
              WCAG AA guidelines. The improved contrast ratio made the overall
              design better.

            <p>My key accomplishments through this project is:</p>
            <p>1. Getting the AHA moment out of artists attending anime conventions, as this would save them a lot of anxiety with table applications.
              <br/>
              2. Impressed the former CEO of Picatic, and was invited to their office.

            <h3>Thinking of Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              After designing the first mock up iteration, I realized that the
              color choice I used was not accessible to the colorblind. This
              made me think more critically about my color choice, understanding
              that accessibility is not an after thought but rather should be
              considered at the start of my design process. Not only did it
              improve my design for those who are colorblind, it improved my
              design overall for everyone.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Successful Usertesting VS Good Design</h3>
            <p>
              After doing countless usertesting, I learned that just because it
              was successful does not completely mean it was good. My users are
              tech literate but used to a tedious process. When there were
              certain features I was able to simplify, the “wow“ I saw on their
              faces was when I knew the “Aha!“ moment came.
