            <p>
              We have a 20-year-old feature-bloated product, severely slowing our feature velocity; blocking the company’s ability to innovate.
            </p>
            <p>Our clients also wanted pieces of our solutions to solve their own business needs. However, this cannot be achieved, as we can only give them all or nothing. 
            </p>
            <h2>Company strategy</h2>
            <p>
              The goal is to modularize pieces of our giant product and turn it into solutions that integrates seamlessly with each other. I was responsible for the point-of-sale
            </p>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>
              Our short term goal is to release the modularized point-of-sale by early 2023, so our strategic partner can pilot in-stores.
            </p>
            <p>Our long term goal is to reduce the transaction time by 30%</p>

            <p>The company is transitioning from a sales-led to a product-led process. There is no process established on how we work together.</p>
            <p>Design is considered an afterthought. Our cross-functional stakeholders often do not know how to collaborate with us from the discovery phase.</p>
            <p>A lot of ambiguity. The only direction given is “modularize the POS” and “needs to work on all devices” by Q1 of 2023</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
              I went on on-site visits, conducted customer interviews with former sales reps, and consulted the CX team to understand what:

            <p>   
              1. The current in-store experience is like today

            <h2>Key findings</h2>
            <p>I mapped out a user journey from the outcomes of my research.</p>

            <p>The average time of transaction is around 45 minutes. Some of the reasons why it takes so long:             
            </p>
            <p> 1. There is a minimum of 2 platforms required to process a transaction. Depending on the complexity, it can be more than 4. (Activation, transactions, warranty, trade-ins.)
              <br/>
              2. Switch & login between multiple systems; forcing the user to remember multiple passwords. The experience is worse for multi-carrier clients.
              <br/>
              3. Contract signing requires printing and re-uploading into multiple systems
              <br/>
              4. Duplicating data entry into multiple systems for the sales rep. Wrong entry of data means reconciliation later on.
              <br/>
              5. End consumers has to repeat themselves twice to provide the same information

            </p>
            <p>We also learned that our clients prioritized speed above everything. Every impact made has to reduce the transaction time. </p>

              I applied the feedback we got from our clients and explored multiple concepts, as well as the high-level vision.

            <p> 
              - Ability to process a non-serialized transaction (non-IMEI)

              - Ability to discount manually
              <br/>
              - Email & print receipt only
              <br/>
              - No cash transactions</p>

            <p>
              We validated the design vision and MVP with our clients to see if it provides enough value for a pilot.
            </p>
            <p>Learnings:
            </p>
            <p>
              - Coupons are a must-have. (They have over 5000 coupons)
              <br/>
              - Unlocked serialized products are a must-have. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This feedback was also used to write MVP requirements

            <p>
              For user testing, I conducted internal, external and went in-store to ensure the design is seamless for the in-store environment.
            </p>
            <p>Key findings were:
            </p>
            <p>
              - The user’s eyes always went to the bottom of the cart first to see if discounts has been applied. 
              <br/>
              - Applying discounts was one too many clicks. At a scale of 200 sales per day, every click saved is time saved.
              <br/>
              - Showing address when searching for a customer is a security risk.
              <br/>
              - Printing receipts is very expensive for the business.

            <p>As design never really had a seat at the table, I was able to be
              included from the very beginning. I was able to establish this process
              with product, and I got a testimonial from my product owner:
            </p>
            <p>
              "...I don't think I've ever had a designer create mocks to share with clients BEFORE requirements were written. it makes a ton of sense to me to do that - to get feedback that can be used to develop the requirements...
            </p>
            <p>...This has been helpful so far in eliciting more meaningful requirements from users..."
