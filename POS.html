            <h2>Business problem</h2>
            <p>
              We have a 20-year-old feature-bloated product, severely slowing our feature velocity; blocking the company’s ability to innovate.
            </p>
            <p>Our clients also wanted pieces of our solutions to solve their own business needs. However, this cannot be achieved, as we can only give them all or nothing. 
            </p>
            <h2>Company strategy</h2>
            <p>
              The goal is to modularize pieces of our giant product and turn it into solutions that integrates seamlessly with each other. I was responsible for the point-of-sale
            </p>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>
              Our short term goal is to release the modularized point-of-sale by early 2023, so our strategic partner can pilot in-stores.
            </p>
            <p>Our long term goal is to reduce the transaction time by 30%</p>

            <p>Design is considered an afterthought. Our cross-functional stakeholders often do not know how to collaborate with us from the discovery phase.</p>
            <p>A lot of ambiguity. The only direction given is “modularize the POS” and “needs to work on all devices” by Q1 of 2023</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
              I went on on-site visits, conducted customer interviews with former sales reps, and consulted the CX team to understand what:
              <br/>
              1. The current in-store experience is like today
              <br/>
              2. Painpoints associated with the process today

            <p>I mapped out a user journey from the outcomes of my research.</p>

            <p>The average time of transaction is around 45 minutes. Some of the reasons why it takes so long:
              <br/>
              1. There is a minimum of 2 platforms required to process a transaction. Depending on the complexity, it can be more than 4. (Activation, transactions, warranty, trade-ins.)
              <br/>
              2. Switch & login between multiple systems; forcing the user to remember multiple passwords. The experience is worse for multi-carrier clients.
              <br/>
              3. Contract signing requires printing and re-uploading into multiple systems
              <br/>
              4. Duplicating data entry into multiple systems for the sales rep. Wrong entry of data means reconciliation later on.
              <br/>
              5. End consumers has to repeat themselves twice to provide the same information

              I created an end-to-end in-store experience vision and shared it with clients to align on the direction we are headed. We were able to validate the direction of frictionless experience on 1 platform.
            </p>
            <p>We also learned that our clients prioritized speed above everything. Every impact made has to reduce the transaction time. </p>

              <br/>
              2. More information about the area, transit and where to stay as a lot of artists travel to sell.

            </p>
            <p>1. Must have: logistical information & policies</p>
            <p>2. Good to have: more general information</p>

            <p>
              To decrease the time for artists to repeated enter the same information during the application process, I split them into
              two categories, the static and the dynamic information
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Static</b> Information being the information that never
              changes. Things like name, address, portfolio, website. All
              organizers need this information, and the user should not have to
              repeatedly input this information
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Dynamic</b> Information being the information that changes. Who
              your table partner is and what your table name will be is always
              something that constantly gets changed
            </p>

              Application is also on mobile view as a lot of artists has other
              jobs in the service industry, and cannot easily access a computer.
              However, when I did my initial interviews, many artists would not
              apply for an application through their phones due to the fear of
              making mistakes.

              Half way through the project, I learned about designing for

              accessibility criterias. I changed the colors that didn't pass the
              WCAG AA guidelines. The improved contrast ratio made the overall
              design better.

            <p>My key accomplishments through this project is:</p>
            <p>1. Getting the AHA moment out of artists attending anime conventions, as this would save them a lot of anxiety with table applications.
              <br/>
              2. Impressed the former CEO of Picatic, and was invited to their office.

            <h3>Thinking of Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              After designing the first mock up iteration, I realized that the
              color choice I used was not accessible to the colorblind. This
              made me think more critically about my color choice, understanding
              that accessibility is not an after thought but rather should be
              considered at the start of my design process. Not only did it
              improve my design for those who are colorblind, it improved my
              design overall for everyone.

          <div>
            <h3>Successful Usertesting VS Good Design</h3>
            <p>
              After doing countless usertesting, I learned that just because it
              was successful does not completely mean it was good. My users are
              tech literate but used to a tedious process. When there were
              certain features I was able to simplify, the “wow“ I saw on their
              faces was when I knew the “Aha!“ moment came.
