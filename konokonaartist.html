              This is my Graduation Project for Emily Carr University. This is a

              <br />
              1. Making artist alley applications easier
              <br />
              2. Helping organizers to manage artist alley applications better

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Getting a booth to sell at an anime convention is inefficient and
              stressful because an artist has to visit an infinite number of
              websites, find the page to apply for tables. Often table
              applications are not even open when they visit the site.
            </p>
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>
              To create a better experience for artists wanting to apply for
              tables at anime conventions.
            </p>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
              Artists usually have second jobs, often in retail or service, that
              does not allow them to use a cellphone when applications open.

              organizers need this information, and the user should not have to
              repeatedly input this information
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Dynamic</b> Information being the information that changes. Who
              your table partner is and what your table name will be is always

              Application is also on mobile view as a lot of artists has other
              jobs in the service industry, and cannot easily access a computer.
              However, when I did my initial interviews, many artists would not
              apply for an application through their phones due to the fear of
              making mistakes.

              Half way through the project, I learned about designing for

              accessibility criterias. I changed the colors that didn't pass the
              WCAG AA guidelines. The improved contrast ratio made the overall
              design better.

          <div>
            <h3>Thinking of Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              After designing the first mock up iteration, I realized that the
              color choice I used was not accessible to the colorblind. This
              made me think more critically about my color choice, understanding
              that accessibility is not an after thought but rather should be
              considered at the start of my design process. Not only did it
              improve my design for those who are colorblind, it improved my
              design overall for everyone.

          <div>
            <h3>Successful Usertesting VS Good Design</h3>
            <p>
              After doing countless usertesting, I learned that just because it
              was successful does not completely mean it was good. My users are
              tech literate but used to a tedious process. When there were
              certain features I was able to simplify, the “wow“ I saw on their
              faces was when I knew the “Aha!“ moment came.
